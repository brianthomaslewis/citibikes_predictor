## Project Charter

### Background

Many tourists visiting NYC find bicycling an ideal way to do sightseeing around the city. With over 1,200 miles of bike lanes throughout the city tens of millions of visitors each year, bike-sharing has become a popular way to deal with the ebb and flow of bicycle demand. Most prominent among these is Citi Bike, the official bike-sharing system of NYC. While Citi Bike allows anyone to obtain instant access to _current, real-time_ inventory of bicycles at all stations around the city, it doesn't provide an easy way to predict which stations will have enough inventory for you and anyone you travel with on the days, times, and locations that you're planning your trip to visit the city.

Even for long-time residents seeking to use Citi Bikes as a commuter vehicle, it isn't always clear which stations will have available bicycles. As of yet, no known solution to solve this planning problem currently exists.

### Vision

To allow tourists or residents in NYC the ability to obtain reasonable predictions about Citi Bike availability at specific stations in the future so that they avoid wasting time trying to find a Citi Bike when they need it.

### Mission

To provide an app that will allow the user to input the following:

 * Date (in the past or the future)
 * Time of day
 * Location

And obtain the following:

 * Top 5 closest Citi Bike stations to the location entered
 * Actual average number of available bicycles at each of the top 5 stations at that time interval (if past date in existing data)
 * Predicted average number of available bicycles at each of the top 5 stations at that time interval (if future date not in existing data)

The predictions will be created after testing a variety of methods for performance, but will likely result from using Holt-Winters forecasting methods.

This app will enable long-time residents as well as short-term tourists the ability to make more reliable plans that involve a Citi Bike. This app should allow the user to decrease their risk of making a plan to use a Citi Bike and arrive at a station only to find no bicycles available. This will enable a more pleasant tourist experience in sightseeing around the city, and a more pleasant commuter experience for residents using Citi Bikes to get to and from work.

Data source: [NYC Citi Bike Trips](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike) (2013-2020), publicly hosted by Google BigQuery 



### Success Criteria

Model performance metric:

 * The model will succeed if it can predict the number of available bikes at a given bike station, date, and time of day with a cross-validation R^2 of 0.7. 

Business metrics (if implemented within the Citi Bike data science team):

 * Rates of return-users of the app
 * (If possible) Linking return-users of the app with actual use metrics of Citi Bike
   * This would allow seeing if users who make use of the app use Citi Bike more than those who do not

## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Adding songs 
To add songs to the database:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

### Example using `python3` as an entry point

We have included another example of a Dockerfile, `app/Dockerfile_python` that has `python3` as the entry point such that when you run the image as a container, the command `python3` is run, followed by the arguments given in the `docker run` command after the image name. 

To build this image: 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

then run the `docker run` command: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane app.py
```

The new image defines the entry point command as `python3`. Building the sample PennyLane image this way will require initializing the database prior to building the image so that it is copied over, rather than created when the container is run. Therefore, please **do the step [Create the database with a single song](#create-the-database-with-a-single-song) above before building the image**.

# Testing

From within the Docker container, the following command should work to run unit tests when run from the root of the repository: 

```bash
python -m pytest
``` 

Using Docker, run the following, if the image has not been built yet:

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

To run the tests, run: 

```bash
 docker run penny -m pytest
```
